STEERING THE HELICOPTER.
------------------------
BY USING THE JOYSTICK YOU CAN MOVE THE STONEAGE HELICOPTER ACROSS THE
SCREEN. TO RAISE THE HELICOPTER,PUSH THE JOYSTICK UPWARDS - THE LONGER THE
STICK IS PUSHED UPWARDS, THE FASTER THE HELICOPTER WILL RISE.
WHEN YOU RELEASE THE STICK. THE HELICOPTER WILL AUTOMATICALLY BEGIN TO
FALL. AND WILL PICK UP SPEED AS IT FALLS. TO INCREASE SPEED AT WHICH THE
HELICOPTER FALLS MOVE THE JOYSTICK DOWNWARDS, YOU CAN MOVE THE HELICOPTER
TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT BY MOVING THE JOYSTICK IN THE APPRPRIATE DIRCETION. IT
IS ALSO POSSIBLE TO MAKE THE HELICOPTER DIVE - THE FASTER THE SPEED OF
DESCENT,THE DEEPER INTO THE WATER THE HELICOPTER WILL DIVE.

--------
THE AIM OF THE GAME IS TO USE THE HELICOPTER TO PICK UP FIGURES WHICH
APPEAR AT THE ENTRANCES TO THE CAVE AND TO TAKE THEM TO THE CAVE INDICATED.
YOU LAND NEXT TO THE CAVE DWELLER, THE FIGURE WILL THEN TELL YOU IN A
SPEECH BUBBLE WHERE IT WANTS TO GO AND THEN CLIMB INTO THE HELICOPTER. YOU
NOW FLY TO THAT DESTINATION, WHERE THE FIGURE WILL GET OUT OF THE
HELICOPTER AUTOMATICALLY. IF YOU FLY THE CAVE DWELLER TO HIS DESTINATION
PARTICULARLY QUICKLY, HE WILL REWARD YOU WITH A BONUS SYMBOL(SCORE) IF YOU
COLLIDE WITH ONE OF THE CAVE DWELLERS WHILE LANDING, HE WILL FALL FROM HIS
PLATFORM INTO THE WATER. YOU CAN RESCUE FIGURES WHO HAVE FALLEN INTO THE
WATER BY LANDING ON THE WATER, THE FIGURE WILL THEN SWIM TOWARDS THE
HELICOPTER. THE ONLY EXCEPTION TO THIS IS THE OLD MAN WHO CANNOT BE RESCUED
AS, OWING TO HIS POOR PHYSICAL CONDITION SINKS AFTER A SHORT TIME.
